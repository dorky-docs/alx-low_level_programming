For this project, we will dive deeper into pointers, arrays and strings. As always, we will be genrating prototypes for each of the tasks for the project. These prototypes will be compiled into the main.h header file. The header file will be pushed to the repository and the files containing the functions in the header file main.h will be made executable and also pushed to the repository
