This project is a very important aspect of C-programming as it explores bit manipulation. This basically means operations are performed bit by bit. Now lets talk about bits which is the smallest storage unit in programming and software itself. Bit is followed closely by byte, magabyte, gigabyte, terabyte. Eight bits equals one byte. Bear this in mind because it will come in handy in our software engineering journey.In this project, we are going to take a stab at tentatively understanding bit manipulation. As always, we will be using prototypes compiled in our header file which will be included in our main codes for each task. Alright, let's div right in shall we.
