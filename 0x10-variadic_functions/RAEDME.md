Hello there, welcome back. Today, we will explore variadic functions in C-programming. Now variadic functions are basically fnctions in C with variable number of arguements. In normal cases, we observed a function having a single type of arguement, however, in variadic functions, we have a variable number of arguments. Sofor variadic functions, it should be notd that you need to declare at least one constant arguement using the const variable name, you will then end it with an elipsis (...). Mind you, your elipsis must come after a comma always. One intriguing part about these functions is that you don't have to determine the number or types of arguments you intend to use in the function, you can keep on adding them and they will all be accepted. Remember, to use the elpsis, we must use the three macros defined in the stdarg.h header file. These macros include, va_list, va_start, va_arg. Alright, let's dive ino our tasks for the day
