Welcome back to low level programming. Today, we will explore function pointers. Yep, you heard that right, remember when we had pointers to variables? Well this is a case where we assign pointers to functions. But wait, there are some things you aught to now before we proceed with or project tasks. For pointers to functions, instead of the pointer holding the memory location of the function, it holds the code of the function. Another interesting fact is that the pointer of a function stores the start of executable code. I guess when you think about it, it makes a lot of sense. The pointer is to the entry point of the code block. I guess this means we will have o call on all our knowledge of assignment and address of operations. I must say, this is quiet an interesting project. C-programming seems to be the gift that keeps on giving. Alrighty, let's start codingcd 0x0F-function_pointers
