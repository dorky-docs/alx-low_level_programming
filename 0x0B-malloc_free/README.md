In this project, let us explore the concept of dynamic memory allocation in C-progrmming. Think of it as you reducing memory wastage on your UNIX system. When you declare and  initialize a function of a particular type, the memory is automatically allocated. So, if you declare, for instance a variable of typw int, the systme automatically allocates a 4-byte memory for it. Now, if you are unable to utilize the enti
re memory allocated to the particular function, that means that block of memory has been wasted. To solve this issue, the concept of malloc was introduced. In this concept, memory is allocated at runtime. The beauty of this concept is the fact that you can free up that memory when you are done using it with the free function. Isn't that the coolest thing you ever heard? Well i know that is the coolest thing i ever heard and i am going to use it to my full advantage.
