Welcome back to malloc and free, i told you we were not done with this project. In this particula project though, we will dive even deeper into malloc and free. Remember when i said malloc aids in memory management? Well i wnat you to add the fact that malloc is a form of dynamic memory allocation at heap. Here, the memory is allocated at runtime, that is, memory is allocated during eecution as opposed to automatic memory allocation where memory is allocted each time a function is called or initialized. In this case, we say, memory is allocated at compile time. I do believe that with time, we will get to really understand malloc, free and even calloc and realloc. For now, let's concentrate on malloc and free... Oh, before i forget, don't forget to free the memory allocated after execution so as not to encounter any form of memory leaks. Also remember that malloc returns a pointer and an address.
