You are welcome to another project in the ALX SWE program where we do hard thingss and 'enjoy' it. I must say, we have cme a long way in this journey and yet we have an even longer way to go. From Hello World to creating out own printf function, we can actually pat ourselves on the back for our resilience through it all. This project in itself explores the concept of singly linked lists in c-programming. Now one would ask, what in the world is a singly linked list? Well, it is basically data structure made up of nodes. Each node consists of a value and a pointer to the address of the next node. This logic creates a link between the first node and the next node and maked access to its elements fairly easy enough. But i will not bore you with the semantics, i will infact show you in the subsequent tasks designed by ALX to make us do hard things. Come along and let's have fun coding
